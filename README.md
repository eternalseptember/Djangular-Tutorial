## Changes
1. I am using Python 3.5, so I had to modify the requirements.txt file to change the django version number and get rid of the wsgiref requirement (because it comes pre-installed in Python3)
2. In "Extending Django's Built-In User Model" section, the folder name containing the settings.py file might not be correct. I changed the settings.py file inside the boilerplate folder.
